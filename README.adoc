COPY pom.xml mvnw ./
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Make Maven wrapper executable
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

== Key Docker Features:

1. **Multi-stage build**: Reduces final image size by separating build and runtime environments
2. **Security**: Runs as non-root user for better security
3. **GraphViz**: Installs GraphViz for diagram generation support
4. **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring
5. **Volume mounts**: Persistent storage for logs and data
6. **Environment variables**: Configurable through environment variables
7. **Spring profiles**: Uses Docker-specific configuration

== Running the Application:

[source,shell script]
----
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t asciidoctor-converter .
docker run -p 7202:7202 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-character-key-here \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/staging:/app/staging \
  asciidoctor-converter
----


== Important Notes:

1. **Security**: Replace the default encryption key with a secure 32-character key
2. **Volumes**: Mount appropriate directories for persistent data
3. **Memory**: Consider adding JVM memory settings if needed: `-Xmx512m -Xms256m`
4. **Networking**: If you need to connect to external services, configure networking appropriately

This setup provides a production-ready Docker configuration for your AsciiDoc converter application.
