== Docker next

Looking at your Spring Boot application, I can see it's an AsciiDoc converter with specific directory configurations and logging setup. Here's the recommended way to dockerize this app:Based on your Spring Boot application that converts AsciiDoc files, here's the recommended way to dockerize it:

== Dockerfile

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Use a multi-stage build to optimize the final image size
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-jammy AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Maven wrapper and pom.xml first (for better layer caching)
COPY pom.xml mvnw ./
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Make Maven wrapper executable
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

# Download dependencies (this layer will be cached if pom.xml doesn't change)
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

# Copy source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Runtime stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy

# Install GraphViz for diagram generation (used by asciidoctor-diagram)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y graphviz && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create app user for security
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Create necessary directories
RUN mkdir -p /app/logs /app/tmp && \
    chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# Copy the JAR file from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Change ownership to app user
RUN chown appuser:appuser app.jar

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose the port your app runs on
EXPOSE 7202

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:7202/converter/actuator/health || exit 1

# Run the application

== Key Docker Features:

1. **Multi-stage build**: Reduces final image size by separating build and runtime environments
2. **Security**: Runs as non-root user for better security
3. **GraphViz**: Installs GraphViz for diagram generation support
4. **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring
5. **Volume mounts**: Persistent storage for logs and data
6. **Environment variables**: Configurable through environment variables
7. **Spring profiles**: Uses Docker-specific configuration

== Running the Application:

[source,shell script]
----
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t asciidoctor-converter .
docker run -p 7202:7202 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-character-key-here \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/staging:/app/staging \
  asciidoctor-converter
----


== Important Notes:

1. **Security**: Replace the default encryption key with a secure 32-character key
2. **Volumes**: Mount appropriate directories for persistent data
3. **Memory**: Consider adding JVM memory settings if needed: `-Xmx512m -Xms256m`
4. **Networking**: If you need to connect to external services, configure networking appropriately

This setup provides a production-ready Docker configuration for your AsciiDoc converter application.
